In the image compression example, the idea is as below:

The images is formed of over 1000 colors, each color is formed of either R G B (0 to 255 intensity).
So we have X = 1000 X 3. Lets say each entry in this X i.e. each row is represented by *.
Now for the sake of simplicity, imagine each color is just formed of either R or G (0 to 255 intensity).
So what we have is a plot of 1000 *'s w.r.t R and G as below:

      |
      |         * ** * 
      |    * *           * * * 
      |     * * * *  
    R |  *   *
      |    *
      | *     *  *   * 
      |
    --|------------------------
      |            G


We run the K-means algorithm on it by specifying K=16. What happens is the algorithm finds 16 clusters in the
above plot. We use the centroid of each cluster as our new *, and replace all the entries in that cluster by this 
value i.e replace all the colors in that cluster by this color. Thus we have a final image with 16 colors.
